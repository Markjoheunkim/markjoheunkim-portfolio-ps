                        This website is the very first one I made. This website consists of Gc maps where you can find their brief history, every room on every floor, faculty members, and the offering programs of each course. I made this website because this is the only one I could think of at that moment. I created this in order to sort and organize the building of Gordon College. I know it's not perfect or responsive either, but you know at least I tried and I passed.
